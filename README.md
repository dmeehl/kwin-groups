# kwin-groups
A kwin script to "group" windows together.

Adds a menu entry to the windows' context menu to add/remove the window from groups.

Any member of a group that is:
- minimized causes the rest of the members to minimize.
- unminimized causes the rest of the members to unminimize.
- activated causes the rest of the members to activate (come to the front).
